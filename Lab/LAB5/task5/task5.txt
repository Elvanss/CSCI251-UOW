My answer:

The purpose of the funcExp(T list[], int size) function is to do a two-fold examination on an array that 
has been provided. It ignores the first element and focuses on the first half of the array first. It carefully 
identifies the area with the most value by carefully sorting through this material. After locating this highest 
value, the function turns its focus to the second half of the array. This time, though, it ignores the last 
component and instead focuses on identifying the number that is the least in this area. 

-> After determining the highest value from the first half and the lowest value from the second, funcExp 
computes their total and displays it as the result of its extensive investigation.
